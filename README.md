#Name of project

Drinks and Food Generator


## Description

- What was your motivation?

The motivation for this project was to create a simple website that people can visit when they have difficulty choosing what to drink or eat. One-click on the shuffle button provides the user with a random drink or food they can make. If they want a specific kind of drink, the user can pick an alcohol they want to make and click choose a drink. The generator will provide them with a drink based on what kind of alcohol they select.


- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?

The main problem we wanted to solve was to give people more choices when making drinks or food. Instead of the same boring beverages and recipes, we wanted to provide the user with various options. That way, they can try new drinks and dishes enjoyed by themselves or with family and friends.

- What did you learn?

This project has made me realize how much a simple code can make or break a website. I was in charge of the HTML and CSS. On the surface, it seemed easy but gathering ideas from everyone and trying to figure out a design we all liked was challenging. It was worth it because it provided me with team experience, where I learned how vital feedback could be for group projects. (Nikhil)
